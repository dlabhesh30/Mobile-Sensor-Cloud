# Mobile-Sensor-Cloud
A Project for the course Cloud Technologies

A mobile sensor cloud created for monitoring the traffic and giving details about the road by using VTA buses as the means of carrying sensors around the city. 
The application is targeted for cities who plan to make their traffic smarter and plan to increase their ease of transport. 
The sensors collect the data about traffic and road in a mobile, dynamic way and communicate it to the nearest hub and the hub in turn posts the data on the cloud making it available online. 

Java Servlet Pages is used in the back end. 
A fully functional user dashboard created for the user using CSS Bootstrap and Javascript.
